# PayPal Developer Support

If you have a feature request, a new integration idea or you would like to file a bug report, please use this [Github issue tracker](https://github.paypal.com/DeveloperPlatform-R/paypalappsupport/issues). 

We _recommend_ that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This would be the fastest way to find a solution to any issue that you are currently facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add detailed steps to reproduce the bug, the PayPal version you're using, and your OS version. Any additional files (error logs, screenshots, videos) would be very helpful and would help us to narrow down the issue as quickly as possible.
