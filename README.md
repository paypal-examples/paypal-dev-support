# PayPal Developer Support

What goes here: 
- Bugs / Issues
- Feature Requests

What does not go here:
- Account issues. Any issues directly related to a PayPal Account need to go through [Customer Support](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/contact-us).

We _recommend_ that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This would be the fastest way to find a solution to any issue that you are currently facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add detailed steps within the issue to reproduce the bug, this includes: 
- PayPal version
- OS version
- Additional files (error logs, screenshots, videos)

This information will help to narrow down the issue as quickly as possible. 

If you have a feature request, a new integration idea or you would like to file a bug report, please use this [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/paypal-examples/paypal-dev-support/issues).
